# Where to find implementations of things
## Note
This is mostly for my own reference. Things are in alphabetical order. Sorry for terrible formatting.
### Dijkstra
* Dijkstra
* Bumps (for nodes referenced by characters)
### Sweep Line Stuff
* CowSteeplechase (2D segment intersection, lots of computational geometry stuff - points, segments, intersection, etc.)
* Stampede (1D segment sweepline)
* CowJog(1D segment overlap)
### Min spanning tree
* SuperBullPrim (prim's minimum spanning tree)
### Safe Combinatorics(inversions, multiplication, factorials, combinations)
* CountTheArrays
### Floodfill
* IcyPerimeter
* CaveAdventure
### String Manipulation
* PrefSuffPalindrome - prefix function
* CensoringSilver - KMP
### Graph stuff
* Piggyback - BFS
* MilkVisits - DFS to find disconnected componenets in a graph
